# Setup

@@@ index

* [bootstrap](bootstrap.md)

The setup of the platform relies on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to bootstrap the required
services.

@@@ note

We are currently working to make this possible but currently our maven repository and docker registry are not public.
We will update this section as soon as these become public. In the meantime you can test the platform by building it
manually, more instructions on how to do so will be added shortly.
